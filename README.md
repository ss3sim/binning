=======================

This folder contains:

- Models, case files, results, plots and figures from the study.
- The code necessary to reproduce the study.

Current contributors: Cole Monnahan, Kotaro Ono, Merrill Rudd, Sean
Anderson, et al.

To reproduce this study:
1. Clone this repository into a local folder.
2. Open the main.R script in R. Use the devtools install commands to
install the correct version of ss3sim and r4ss. Set the ss3sim executables
in the system PATH (see vignette for help).
3. Set the number of cores you would like to use. Run the code in Step 0,
including sourcing the startup.R script, and installing whichever packages
you need to. The workspace should now be ready.
4. Run steps 2 and 3, which may take a week or longer and a lot of disk
space.
5. Run step 4 to reproduce plots (not in the paper) and figures (are in
the paper
